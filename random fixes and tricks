i) cinnamon high cpu usage fix (by simply restarting it out):
cltrl + alt + esc                                                                                                                                                        

ii) while booting up linux mint blank screen or whatever issue on ryzen 5 3500u (thats mine)
reason: it happens due to kinda not complete presence of GPU drivers in 5.4 kernels (which linux mint ships with) 

Fixes: 1) press cltrl+alt+F1 to open teminal -> login -> pkill cinnamon 
        thats it now cinnamon will restart and hopefully fixed issue

    2) upgrade kernel to above 5.8, i.e. boot with kernel and  vmlinuz of v5.8 or above kernel


iii) switching desktops (aka workspaces): ctrl +alt/gr + < / >

iv) open ttys:

ctrl+ alt+ F1 .. F6 will give terminal and F7 will give open the GUI tty , i.e. tty7

Thats all!
